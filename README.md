## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML and CSS

Home page animation is done with animation in CSS. The cut on the bottom of the blue background is done with transform (skewY) in CSS. The header/nav and the languages section are displayed using flex. The stats, cli, cloud and footer sections are displayed using grid.
On the Features page, the cards are displayed using grid and the content inside the cards is displayed with flex.

## Optimizations
Add media query between 769 px and 975px - The form on the home page extends beyond the container/section creating a horizontal scroll bar.
Adding Essentials & Deployment content & links to the Documentation page.

## Lessons Learned:
Using variables to store colors in CSS is very handy.
CSS Animations and transformations are very powerful and beautiful.
Creating a separate utility file for styling helps write less code.
